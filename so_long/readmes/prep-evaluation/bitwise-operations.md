Absolutely—let’s dive into how you can use “bit-twiddling” to store a “visited” flag in the same byte that represents your map tile. We’ll start with the basics and move toward an example of applying it in your flood fill (BFS/DFS) algorithm.

## 1. The Concept of Using Bits as Flags

In C, a `char` is typically 8 bits, meaning you have bits numbered 0 through 7. When we do things like:

- `|=` (bitwise OR-assignment)
- `&=` (bitwise AND-assignment)
- `&` (bitwise AND)
- `|` (bitwise OR)
- `^` (bitwise XOR)
- `~` (bitwise NOT)

we’re manipulating these individual bits.

Let’s say your map is stored in a 2D array of `char`. For each `map[x][y]`:

- The **lowest bits** (0–6) will still hold your existing map information (e.g., `'0'`, `'1'`, `'C'`, etc.).  
- The **highest bit** (bit 7) will be your “visited” marker.

In hexadecimal, 0x80 represents the byte `1000 0000` in binary (bit 7 is 1, bits 0–6 are 0).  

- Setting this bit: `map[x][y] |= 0x80;`  
- Clearing this bit: `map[x][y] &= 0x7F;` (0x7F is `0111 1111` in binary)  
- Checking this bit: `(map[x][y] & 0x80) != 0`  

### Why 0x80 and 0x7F?
- **0x80** in binary is `1000 0000`. OR-ing with that will set bit 7 to 1.  
- **0x7F** in binary is `0111 1111`. AND-ing with that will set bit 7 to 0 (and keep bits 0–6 unchanged).

## 2. Bitwise Operators in C

1. **Bitwise AND** `&`
   - Compares each bit of two operands. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, 0.
   - Example: 
     - `0x05 & 0x03` → in binary:  
       - `0x05` = `0101`  
       - `0x03` = `0011`  
       - Result = `0001` (0x01).  

2. **Bitwise OR** `|`
   - Compares each bit of two operands. If at least one bit is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, 0.
   - Example:
     - `0x05 | 0x03` → in binary:  
       - `0x05` = `0101`  
       - `0x03` = `0011`  
       - Result = `0111` (0x07).  

3. **Bitwise XOR** `^`
   - Compares each bit of two operands. Result is 1 if bits differ, 0 if they’re the same.
   - Example:
     - `0x05 ^ 0x03` → in binary:  
       - `0x05` = `0101`  
       - `0x03` = `0011`  
       - Result = `0110` (0x06).  

4. **Bitwise NOT** `~`
   - Flips each bit.  
   - Example:
     - `~0x05` →  
       - `0x05` = `0000 0101` (in 8 bits)  
       - `~0x05` = `1111 1010` (which as a signed char might be -6 in two’s complement).  

5. **Compound Assignments** (`|=`, `&=`, etc.)
   - `x |= y;` is shorthand for `x = x | y;`.  
   - `x &= y;` is shorthand for `x = x & y;`.  

So, `map[x][y] |= 0x80;` means:  
1. Read the current byte from `map[x][y]`.  
2. OR it with `0x80` (binary `1000 0000`).  
3. Store the result back into `map[x][y]`.  
4. This sets bit 7 to 1, leaving bits 0–6 unchanged.

## 3. Storing Tile Type + Visited Bit

### How do you keep track of the tile type if you’re using the top bit for “visited”?

**Mask out the visited bit** when you want to check the actual tile type. For example:

```c
// Get the tile type, ignoring the visited bit:
char tile_type = map[x][y] & 0x7F;  // 0x7F = 0111 1111

// Now tile_type will be the original '0'/'1'/'C'/'E', etc. 
// without bit 7 set.
```

**Check if visited** by doing:
```c
if (map[x][y] & 0x80) {
    // It's visited
} else {
    // It's not visited
}
```

---

## 4. Example: Using It in a BFS/DFS

Let’s say we want to run a BFS to see which tiles are reachable from the player’s start position `(px, py)`. We want to mark each tile’s “visited” bit when we enqueue it in BFS so we don’t enqueue it multiple times.

Here’s a **rough** BFS outline:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Direction vectors for up/down/left/right
static const int DIRECTIONS[4][2] = {
    {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}
};

void flood_fill_bfs(char **map, int width, int height, int start_x, int start_y) {
    // We'll use a simple queue. You can do a manual queue struct or use a list, etc.
    // For simplicity, let's assume we have a small BFS queue array.
    // (In real code, handle dynamic resizing or a proper queue library.)
    
    // Mark the start tile as visited:
    map[start_x][start_y] |= 0x80;  // set bit 7

    // Let's keep an index-based queue
    int queue_size = width * height;
    int (*queue)[2] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 2 * queue_size); // store x,y pairs
    int front = 0;
    int back = 0;

    // Enqueue the starting position
    queue[back][0] = start_x;
    queue[back][1] = start_y;
    back++;

    // BFS
    while (front < back) {
        int cx = queue[front][0];
        int cy = queue[front][1];
        front++;

        // Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = cx + DIRECTIONS[i][0];
            int ny = cy + DIRECTIONS[i][1];

            // Bounds check
            if (nx < 0 || nx >= height || ny < 0 || ny >= width) {
                continue;
            }

            // Is it already visited?
            if (map[nx][ny] & 0x80) {
                // Already visited
                continue;
            }

            // Check if it's a wall or not
            char tile_type = map[nx][ny] & 0x7F; // ignore visited bit

            if (tile_type != '1') { // '1' being a WALL in your scheme
                // Mark visited
                map[nx][ny] |= 0x80;
                
                // Enqueue
                queue[back][0] = nx;
                queue[back][1] = ny;
                back++;
            }
        }
    }

    free(queue);
}
```

### Post-BFS Checks
Once you’ve run this BFS (or DFS), you can check if your collectables and exit are reachable:

```c
bool check_map_validity(char **map, int width, int height,
                        t_position *collectables, int num_collectables,
                        t_position exit_pos) {
    // After BFS, each visited tile has bit 7 set.

    // Check each collectable:
    for (int i = 0; i < num_collectables; i++) {
        int cx = collectables[i].x;
        int cy = collectables[i].y;
        if (!(map[cx][cy] & 0x80)) {
            // Not visited => not reachable
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check exit
    int ex = exit_pos.x;
    int ey = exit_pos.y;
    if (!(map[ex][ey] & 0x80)) {
        // Not visited => not reachable
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

---

## 5. Unmarking “Visited” (If Needed)

In some games, you might want to “reset” the visited status after checking. You can do:

```c
// Clear the visited bit for every tile:
for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
        map[i][j] &= 0x7F;  // force bit 7 to 0
    }
}
```

But from your description, you only need the BFS at the start of the game to verify map correctness, so you might not need to unmark.

## 6. Implementation Tips

1. **Watch Out for Signed `char`**  
   - In C, a `char` can be signed or unsigned depending on your compiler/implementation. If it’s signed, bit 7 might be a “sign bit,” and that can cause weird behaviors if you treat it as a normal 8-bit value. To avoid confusion, you might want to explicitly use `unsigned char **map;` or store your map as an `int**` or something else. But many times, this “just works,” it’s just something to be mindful about.

2. **Be Consistent with Masking**  
   - Always use `map[x][y] & 0x7F` if you want to know the underlying tile.  
   - Always check `(map[x][y] & 0x80) != 0` if you want to know if visited is set.

3. **Memory**  
   - Using the top bit for visited is very memory-efficient. You’re basically storing two pieces of information in one byte.  

4. **Maintainability**  
   - Document this approach well in your code comments. Future you (or future teammates) might wonder where your actual tile data went!

## 7. Summary

- **What `|= 0x80` does**: It sets the highest bit in the `char`. In binary, `0x80` is `1000 0000`. OR-ing with that bit sets it to 1.  
- **What `&= 0x7F` does**: It clears the highest bit. `0x7F` is `0111 1111` in binary. AND-ing with that keeps bits 0–6 and forces bit 7 to 0.  
- **What `(map[x][y] & 0x80) != 0` does**: It checks if the highest bit is 1 (i.e., visited).  
- **What `(map[x][y] & 0x7F)` does**: It gives you the tile type (bits 0–6), ignoring the visited bit.

By layering your visited flag on top of your tile data, you avoid the need for a separate `visited[][]` array, saving memory—especially valuable if your maps get really large. Just remember to carefully mask out the bits when you need the underlying tile or when you want to check/reset visited. Good luck with your bit operations exam!
